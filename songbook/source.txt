To catch the throat and break the spine

And they hoy them down the pit of hell.
Doon ye go, and fare ye well,

So join the union while you may.
Don't wait till your dying day,

{Gmaj7}Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home We got down to the gate
And I was {C13#11}dreaming of the night
{B9}Would it turn out right
How to {Gmaj7}tell you girl
I want to {C13#11}build my world around you
{B9}Tell you that it's true
{Gmaj7}      I want to make you understand
I'm {Bb9}talkin' about a lifetime {D}plan{ Em7/D       D}

That's the way it began, we were hand in hand
Glenn Miller's Band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tunes (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
And on the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone

{Gmaj7}Hurry, don't be late, {C13/G}I can hardly wait
I {B9}said to myself when we're old
We'll go {Gmaj7}dancing in the dark
{Bb9}Walking through the park
And remi{D}niscing{ Em7/D       D}

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

[title] Wicked Game

The {Bm}world was on fire and {A}no one could save me but {E}you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you (This world is only gonna break your heart)
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do

And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)

{[Am  G  Em]x2}
All {Am}things are quite {D}silent, each mortal at {Am}rest,
When me and {Em}my  {D}true love lay {Em}snug in one nest,
When a {D}bold set of {C}ruffians broke {D}into our {C}cave,
And they {Am}forced my dear {D}jewel to plough the salt {[Am  G  Em]x2}wave.

I begged hard for my darling as I would for my life.
But they'd not listen to me although a fond wife,
Saying: The king must have sailors, to the seas he must go,
And they left me lamenting in sorrow and woe.

Through green fields and meadows we of times have walked,
And the fond recollections together have talked,
Where the lark and the blackbird so sweetly did sing,
And the lovely thrushes' voices made the valleys to ring.

Now although I'm forsaken, I won't be cast down.
Who knows but my true love some day may return
And will make me amends for my trouble and strife,
And me and my true love might live happy for
{Am G Em Am G E}life.

[title] My Own Version of You
[credit] Bob Dylan 

[structure] Intro: Am  Am/G  Am/F#  Am/F  x2

{Am}All {Am/G}throug{Am/F#}h the s{Am/F}ummers, into January
{Am}I've{Am/G} been {Am/F#}visitin{Am/F}g morgues and monasteries
{Dm}Look{Dm/C}ing fo{Dsus/B}r the ne{Dsus#4/Bb}cessary bo{(x10234)}dy parts
{Am}Limb{Am/G#}s and l{Am/G}ivers {Am/F#}and brains and hearts
{F}I'll bring someone to life, is what I wanna do
{F7}I wanna create my own version of you

Well, it must be the winter of my discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you, wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
But not for a minute do I believe anything they say
I'm gonna bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean

I'll take the <i>Scarface</i> Pacino and the <i>Godfather</i> Brando
Mix it up in a tank, and get a robot commando
If I do it up right and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look in my face with your sightless eyes?
Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel

I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all mankind
I say to the willow tree, "Don't weep for me"
I'm saying to hell with all things that used to be
Well, I get into trouble, then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between one and two
And I ask myself, "What would Julius Caesar do?"
I will bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes, it'll be done when it's done
 
I'm gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that I can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down, not that far to walk
I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved in any insignificant details

You can bring it to St. Peter, you can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over, bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense

Can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk that good land mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark in the wee, small hours

I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there, it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down? Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me please?
Stand over there by the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery
Long before the first Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right into the burnin' hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
Got the right spirit, you can feel it you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn
It creeps in your body, the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity that runs at top speed
Shimmy your ribs, I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jump-start my creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears

Heads of the characters hammer through daisies
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished
He called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?

Her name is Lola
She was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco
But not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
and she's lost her mind

[title] The Gambler

On a {E}warm summer's evenin' on a {A/E}train bound for {E}nowhere,
I met up with a gambler; we were both too tired to {B}sleep.
So {E}we took turns a starin' out the {A/E}window at the {E}darkness
'til {A/E}boredom overtook {E}us, {B}and he began to {E}speak.

He said, "{E}Son, I've made a life out of {A/E}readin' people's {E}faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their {B}eyes.
And if {E}you don't mind my sayin', I can {A/E}see you're out of {E}aces.
For a {A/E}taste of your {E}whiskey I'll {B}give you some {E}advice."

So I {E}handed him my bottle and he {A}drank down my last {E}swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a {B}light.
And the {E}night got deathly quiet, and his {A}face lost all expr{E}ession.
Said, "If you're {A}gonna play the game, {E}boy, ya gotta {B}learn to play it {E}right.

You got to {E}know when to hold 'em,{A} know when to {E}fold 'em,
{A}know when to {E}walk away and know when to {B}run.
You never {E}count {F#m/B}your   {E}money when you're {A}sittin' at the {E}table.
There'll be {A}time enough for {E}countin' {B} when the dealin's {E}done.

{F}Every gambler knows that the {Bb}secret to sur{F}vivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to {C}keep.
'Cause {F}every hand's a winner and {Bb}every hand's a {F}loser,
and the {Bb}best that you can {F}hope for is to {C}die in your {F}sleep."

And {F}when he'd finished speakin', he {Bb}turned back towards the {F}window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to {C}sleep.
And {F}somewhere in the darkness the {Bb}gambler, he broke {F}even.
But {Bb}in his final {F}words I found an {C}ace that I could {F}keep.

You got to {F}know when to hold 'em,{Bb} know when to {F}fold 'em,
{Bb}know when to {F}walk away and know when to {C}run.
You never {F}count {Gm/C}your {F}money when you're {Bb}sittin' at the {F}table.
There'll be time {Bb}enough for {F}countin' {C}when the dealin's {F}done.

And they rode faster than the wind
Until they came to a desert wide

They rode through red blood to the knee
And they saw neither sun nor moon
But heard the roaring of the sea
